This is a basic LLM-based chatbot for the chat app Revolt. It requires an ollama backend, supports multiple models per channel and custom prompts as well as automatic history keeping. It's easy to set up and configure:
* Clone the repo.
* Copy config.ini.template to config.ini.
* Create a bot in the My Bots section in the Revolt settings.
* Add the bot to a server of your choosing.
* In the ini file: Add your token and adjust the other parameters as desired. You probably have to delete the comments as well.

That's it! Just mention the bot in a message and wait for the reply.
There are some minor known issues that I may fix over time if there is demand.
